#Notational Strategies

Move away from sixteen deep choir staff. Instead use SATB with occassional four part divisi for density.

Text exists to be read over lines vertically so that the whole impression is only given when looking at the score.

Generous repetitions are used to overcome the horizontal limitations of the page. Careful staggering of the voltas can be used to imitate the feathered brushstrokes of Newman while also leaving large blank spaces.

Graphically, a section of the score may look like a thick blank line of whole rests down the page. With staggered voltas however, it may sonically be quite different.
