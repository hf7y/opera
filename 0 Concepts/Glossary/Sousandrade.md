In 1877, this contemporary of Baudelaire, who lived in the United States for ten years, wrote what Haroldo de Campos regards as the foundation stone of concretud: a long poem entitled O guesa errante, which culminates in an astonishing sequence--"Wall Street Hell"--which might be described as textual marquetry or polyphony, in which layout, neologisms, verbal montage and sudden changes in tone evoke the newspapers of that period and the hectic world of the stock market. It is a typographical explosion in a pre-Poundian expanding universe.
