# On Appropriation

Hesse takes liberally 
with the greed of an innocent and goodhearted child.
He isn't the colonizer of the stick sort. 
Not a dutchman topping off stock of fourthousand Bandanians,
keelhauling in new blood at the replacement rate.

He loves as he apprehends, Hesse.
But does he apprehend it all?
What about those transcription errors,
those cultural idioms,
those [liberal interventions](Schoenberg via Nono)?
What happens when Hesse mismatches the Madras?

Nono was a student of power.
I flubbed the question on Gramsci;
O that perfect lunch, Rachel.
The waiter knew to bring the desert
before the peroration.

Hesse's power, leatherbound
Vedas in translation with the accent
of the protestant vernacular.
The pagans who worship man-as-god,
resurrecting. Hesse writes the journey
of one man.

The plurality of the many-bellied Buddah
is an heirloom way of knowing, porcelain
mostly. Coated in scent ash and always
with the three oranges. Heritage is
the sticks stuck rude in the rice.

Then let me take as Hesse takes. Winsomely
playing with the toys at my disposal.
