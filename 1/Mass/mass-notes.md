#Notes O'Connor '03



##Parts of the Mass

###Entrance Song
> open the celebration, intensify unity, lead their thoughts, accompany the procession
"In its most complete version, it consists of an antiphon, psalm verse and Gloria Patri," [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introit).


###Greeting
Sign of the cross makes the presence of Christ known

###Penitential Rite (Kyrie Eleison)
Non-specifc and somewhat variable. It seems the priest may do any "sacramental introduction."
A chant ordinarily done by all, by the people and with the choir.
The presider chooses from three options: the Confitetor, a litanty, or Kyrie Eleison.
####The Confitetor
Preceded by: "Priest says the whole of psalm 42 alternating with the server" [FSSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUCa0pkPBhs)
####Litany
####Kyrie Eleison
First praise the lord. Secondly, ask for mercy. 
####Sprinkling
In place of the customary act of penitence, the priest blesses water and sprinkles it to recall baptism. This happens especially during the Easter Season.

###Gloria
Said or sung during the high seasons (Easter and Christmas).
"Fasted" from during Lent. When omitted, it is not replaced by anything.

###Opening Prayer
Also known as the "collect" [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collect)

* priest says, "Let us pray."
* assembly prays in silence
* priest says the opening prayer
* collects prays of the assembly and directs them to the Trinity
* all are seated
