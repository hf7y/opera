#Form

* 14 one minute Webernesques

* Pierrot Ensemble breaks down into 4 choruses
* * SATB + Flute
* * SATB + Clarinet + Percussion
* * SATB + Violin + Cello
* * SATB + Piano

* Text is based on a short poem (dozen lines)
* Each chorus sets one of the lines at a time 
* * simultaneously with other choruses
* Example, all choruses set the same line
* * Clearer meaning
* No one voice repeats a line
* But other choruses will repeat the same line in the same way
* * Like a motive

Think of each chorus as one multi-timbral voice

In sum, the form of the piece is like an array
* 14 one minute stations on the time axis
* 4 choruses on the orchestration axis
* 14 \* 4 = 54 minute\*choruses
