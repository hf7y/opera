# Concretismo

How should we define concrete poetry and itsessence, concretud (concreteness)?" Instead of being a poem in the conventional sense, a concrete poem is akin to a diagram or drawing, a pattern on the printed page which forcefully and efficiently represents not only objects or concepts but the relationship between them, the invisible structures of sound and meaning that bind them together, their hidden affinities or antagonisms. What is more, as Guillaume Apollinaire put it, writing must be understood in analytical and discursive terms before its all-embracing ideographic message can be understood.
