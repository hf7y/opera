#After Barnett Newman's *The Ideographic Picture*

##Original (linebreaks Pine)
1. The basis of an aesthetic art is the pure idea
2. But the pure idea is, of necessity, an aesthetic act.
3. Here then is the epistemological paradox that is the artist's problem.

4. Not space cutting nor space building,
5. not construction nor fauvist destruction;
6. not the pure line, straight and narrow,
7. nor the tortured line, distorted and humiliating;
8. not the accurate eye, all fingers,
9. nor the wild eye or dream, winking;

10. but the idea-complex that makes contact with mystery
11. ---of life, of me, of nature
12. of the hard, black chaos that is death,
13. or the grayer, softer chaos that is tragedy.

14. For it is only the pure idea that has meaning.
15. Everything else has everything else.
