#Cage, J. *Early Electronic and Tape Music,* Sub Rosa.


##"Fontana Mix"

I am interested in the tape accompaniment to this piece, not necessarily in the vocal aria with which it is typically paired.
Noise sounds give the impression of the fuzzy radio, the radio in-and-of-itself as a sound as opposed to the radio as *transmitter* of another sound source.
The soprano does monopolize the ear's attention, which makes it hard to focus on the electronics.

Sounds register as either abstract/electronic or referrential.
In this way, the "radio" is slipping between its two roles: as sonic-object-as-such; and as transmitter/carrier.

Thirteen minutes long, but with Cage I imagine the texture is communicated by the five minute mark. Moving on.


##"Imaginary Landscape No. 5"

Dominated by quotations here.
The "electronic" medium does not have a *sound of its own* as in the "Fontana Mix".
Silece figures more heavily here, especially as the interruption of quotation.
Fragmentation is another feature of manipulation.
Superposition.

There is an interesting interaction when music is allowed to persist long enough.
It moves beyond the fragment stage which is predominantly concered with identifiability (or not).
Instead, it suggests its own sound world, its own rules and consciousness for listening which I as a listener am invited into.
When this medium-duration event is finally interrupted, I have the experience of being pulled from that consciousness.


##"WBAI"

Name must be in referrence to a radio station.
Those radio-as-radio sounds are more heavily presented here, figuring as more than half of the sonic landscape.
Some baroque quotation is presented/fragmented as one element of many.
This is not a montage of quotes like "Imaginary Landscape No. 5" is.

Electronic sounds themselves are interrupted; no one sound is allowed to persist long enough for me to fall into it.
Maybe this is because these sounds do not present such a familiar mode of "consciousness" like the baroque sounds do.
I would need to discover how to listen to them, first.
I feel like there is not enough time in any of the presentations.

Maybe over time, the sum total of these electronic sounds gives me the impression of a sound world/consciousness which I can fall into.

Overall, very nice "radio sounding" sounds, especially the high-pitched sine tone.


##"Cartridge Music"

Vaguely electronic trippy modernism.
